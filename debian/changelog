rxvt-beta (2.7.10-7maruska) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian: drop quilt (patch & unpatch steps)
  * Keep Alt Mask. Alt ... but not complete!!!
  * scrolling with Alt-p/n & i/k
  * set the PID on the window as _NET_WM_PID property
  * add debianization: compat 9
  * fix: on shrinking (vertically) the window, push the top lines into scroll-back
  * optimize: avoid reading from X, when previous select() said nothing-there
  * tabify
  * When obscured don't rush to "update"; ignore it and stay in Select (without timeout 0).
  * verbose
  * Ignore focus events due to NotifyPointer
  * refresh keyboard "modifiers" on MappingNotify, i.e. keymap-change.
  * Don't switch on aplication-keyboard, on startup/init (todo: make it configurable!)
  * Workaround occasional (frequent) deadlock on exit. -- don't call atexit(rxvt_clean_exit)
  * Define and create the GC for filling with "background" color.
  * When creating a window, use BG pixmap None, and bitGravity .
  * Use XFillRectangle instead of XClearArea in useful macros.
  * Avoid XSetWindowBackground call when setting custom background color or Pixmap.
  * remove more XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap() calls because of transparency support.
  * CWBackPixmap on the outer window, rather than BackPixel
  * Handle the Expose evey by explicit fill -- where? the 4 sides around terminal text?
  * rxvt_scr_clear does not XClearWindow -- it just asks for "refresh"
  * tab AT
  * change to EXTPROTO (keys)
  * optimize: replace calloc with alloc (no zeroing needed).
  * rxvt_alloc() to be used instead of Calloc
  * color logging
  * debug
  * debhelper/compat 12
  * Force color on GCC -- in rules
  * .gitignore
  * spaces
  * drop unused variables
  * use the correct INT_MAX, not MAX_INT
  * fix: pty
  * ok, only XIM
  * fix misleading alignment
  * safe
  * spaces
  * unsuccessful attempt to avoid warnings about .....
  * feat: new Esc sequence to set Selection -- mockup
  * new Esc sequence to set Gravity -- mockup
  * smooth-scrolling parameters.
  * Esc params for bell/override
  * Introduce scroll1.c for parts of rxvt_scr_refresh() -- "clear_borders"
  * spin-off & formalize cleanup_cursor_and_outline() functionality.
  * verbose in cleanup_cursor_and_outline
  * spin-off: set_cursor_characters() -- more flexible: primary/secondary ?
  * spin-off:  try_to_scroll
  * comments & logs
  * refresh_type ?
  * re-spin (from rxvt_scr_refresh): redraw_matrix & support functions:
  * move macros
  * introduce RS_needs_redraw: means the glyph cell has to be redrawn.
  * mark_damaged_chars_from_left: use rs_needs_redraw
  * add snapshot into "struct rxvt_vars"
  * change PRIMARY from keyboard
  * current-output
  * keep the Snapshot: resize & deallocate
  * exchange_snapshot_screen !
  * update-matrix possibly from SECONDARY. make the algorithm work with either secondary or primary .... just a trick.
  * clear vs Secondary
  * change in variables for  rxvt_scr_refresh -- cleanup:
  * Introduce heckel.c, add into the Build system
  * Introduce scroll.c with new functions: verify_scroll, scroll_fluidly, try_to_scroll_smoothly.
  * mark an explicit request for scrolling
  * when I resize Window, deliver to rxvt_resize_all_windowsthe x/y as well
  * even on slow link expose ....  Correct: unify, drop #if
  * check-for-scrolling
  * shift & snapshot
  * try_to_scroll_smoothly
  * xflush anyway!
  * comments & tracing
  * adapt rxvt_resize_all_windows  1
  * dependency on scroll
  * cannot hold inlines
  * during screen tear-down ... unused
  * Extract the selection (primary and cut_buffer0) setting
  * scroll unused var
  * assert CLIPBOARD as well, correctly Atom
  * heckel drop
  * assert_single_selection() & careful with selection time
  * extra careful -- double check we own
  * set selection from Esc -- implementation
  * Bind C-M-y to paste the selection.
  * Switch to ^T instead of ^R -- for print?
  * enforce NOT listening on the property-changes on Root
  * spaces
  * don't request secondary
  * space
  * Print errors
  * Use StaticGravity on the "outer" window?
  * gravity of the inner / VT window. Fixme: somehow already set before.
  * Static Window gravity for the outer. So, when growing, the inner stays.
  * gravity param
  * bit_gravity ?
  * Gravity setting
  * gravity: tabify & debug
  * Esc seq. to set Gravity
  * Esc seq to set SECONDARY display
  * gravity -- implementation
